Welcome to the tennis trajectory tracker!

To begin using the code, please select and run the Frontpage.py file.

Make a choice of either calculations with Topspin or Backspin. There is another option included which allows inputted CSV files which will
calculate the trajectory for you. Please note that if you choose to import your own csv files, they must be stored under the "Tennis" folder 
and should be renamed csv1.csv and csv2.csv in order for proper usage.

After making a selection of either Topspin or Backspin please enter the desired values into the respective fields with all values being greater than zero. 
    The following inputs are calculated in the following units: initial ball equation (x and y coordinate), velocity (km/h), initial angle of ball (degrees), spin rate (revolutions per minute)
    
After entering all of your values click on "calculate" and a graph will be generated for you. 
    On the graph there are points shown where you can hover your mouse over the point and find the details of that specific point.
    If the CSV is being imported the same details will be avaialble for viewing. 

If you would like to calculate another trajectory please close out of the current window to return to the "home" screen and select another option from there. 

All calculations entered will be saved as a CSV file under the "Tennis" directory and can be saved for future useage by renaming the file and saving it. If this is not done,
when a new calculation is done the previous data will be over written.
